Enter the map from valve name to pin numbers in file config.txt
in this format:

VALVE1_NAME pin1 pin2 ...
VALVE2_NAME pin1 pin2 ...
...

All empty lines are ignored
ERROR when getPins is called on valve name that isn't contained in config.txt
All non-numeric pin values are ignored
If multiple valve names are listed, then all corresponding pins are also set to mode

Instructions:
1. Edit config.txt with the correct format for launch pins
2. Edit /home/pi/pin_manage/config.txt to be pins that crontab will set to output
3. In "log" directory, add a new log file named "log.txt"
    (if this file exists, new output is replaced)
    (if no such file exists, file is attempted to be created)
