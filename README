Launch-controller:

* The web and backend interface for wireless ignition of UCLA Rocket Project's 2017 IREC Competition Rocket.

* This system wirelessly toggles pins, reads pin status, and logs operations through an Apache server running on Raspberry Pi

* Authentication system user/password login to operate valves

Enter the map from valve name to pin numbers in file config.txt
in this format:

VALVE1_NAME pin1 pin2 ...
VALVE2_NAME pin1 pin2 ...
...

All empty lines are ignored
ERROR when getPins is called on valve name that isn't contained in config.txt
All non-numeric pin values are ignored
If multiple valve names are listed, then all corresponding pins are also set to mode

Instructions:
1. Edit config.txt with the correct format for launch pins
2. Edit /home/pi/pin_manage/config.txt to be pins that crontab will set to output
3. In "log" directory, add a new log file named "log.txt"
    (if this file exists, new output is replaced)
    (if no such file exists, file is attempted to be created)
4. Authentication server requirements:
	a. server = "localhost"
	   user   = "root"
	   db     = "login_db"
5. getStatus.php runs (every 100ms) & displays live pin status on website
6. In case valves need to be changed, specify new configuration in config/init and run:
        python build.py
   This builds new directory structure to match the config file
